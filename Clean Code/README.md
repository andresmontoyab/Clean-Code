# Clean Code

In this repository is going to be summmary of the book `Clean Code by Robert C. Martin`, I really hope that this information help you to improve your programming skills.

## Clean Code

- Clean code is a code that has been taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly. They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared.

- Spending time keeping your code clean is not just effective, it's a matter of professional survival.

- Managers aregoing to defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that's their job. It's your job to defend the code with equal passion.

- In short, a programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen through a series of transformations until is elegantly coded system.

- Making the code easier to read actually makes it easier to write.
