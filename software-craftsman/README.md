# Software Craftsman

## Ideology and Attitude.

If you couldn’t understand a piece of code, normally it was because
you were not senior enough.

The
solution to this problem was let’s add abstractions and design patterns all over the place. Today, we call it
overengineering and stupidity. Back then we called it architecture and seniority.

What I’m saying is that we should choose our career path according to our passion, to what we love
doing. It doesn’t matter if it is architecture, software development, testing, business analysis, management, or something
else. They are all necessary and important.

### Seniority

There is a huge difference between having ten years of experience and having one year of experience repeated ten
times. Ten years spent working on different projects, with different technologies, and for different companies is different
from ten years working for the same company, on the same project, and with the same people and same technology.

### A New Reality

Companies are looking for developers who,
besides being great at writing code, can also help in many other areas of the business.

Clients want more things faster, and companies are becoming far more aggressive with their
software offerings. Being able to change the software fast, with quality, and increase the value provided to clients became
a massive competitive advantage.
