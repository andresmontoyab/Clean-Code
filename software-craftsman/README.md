# Software Craftsman

## Ideology and Attitude.

If you couldn’t understand a piece of code, normally it was because
you were not senior enough.

The
solution to this problem was let’s add abstractions and design patterns all over the place. Today, we call it
overengineering and stupidity. Back then we called it architecture and seniority.

What I’m saying is that we should choose our career path according to our passion, to what we love
doing. It doesn’t matter if it is architecture, software development, testing, business analysis, management, or something
else. They are all necessary and important.

### Seniority

There is a huge difference between having ten years of experience and having one year of experience repeated ten
times. Ten years spent working on different projects, with different technologies, and for different companies is different
from ten years working for the same company, on the same project, and with the same people and same technology.

### A New Reality

Companies are looking for developers who,
besides being great at writing code, can also help in many other areas of the business.

Clients want more things faster, and companies are becoming far more aggressive with their
software offerings. Being able to change the software fast, with quality, and increase the value provided to clients became
a massive competitive advantage.

### Agile

Agile is a combination of methodologies and techniques that, according to the context, can
help teams and companies to adapt to the ever-changing nature of software projects and also reduce the risks associated with them.

Process-oriented disciplines help teams to keep the focus on what is really important and valuable to the business.

```We don’t do Agile. Either we are Agile or we are not.```

Agile methodologies are all about quick and short feedback loops.

Being good at writing code is the minimum skill expected from software professionals. Testing, analysis, 
ability to understand the business, good communication, and a more extroverted personality became
part of the skill set that software professionals need today.

#### Agile Manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over process and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

#### Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the
customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to
the shorter time scale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust
them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is
face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to
maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its
behavior accordingly.
